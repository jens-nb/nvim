# Neovim Configuration

This repo contains my own Neovim configuration.  
I take inspiration from popular Nvim distributions like [Lunarvim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim)
or projects like [nvim-basic-ide](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide).
However, I'm trying to find my own way of configuring things as I go
and learn more about how to configure Neovim and make it my own.  

## Focus on Stability

I've built Nvim from source and pinned my plugins on specific commits in order to be independent from updates.
This way, I can do specific updates whenever I want and fix breaking changes much more easily.
